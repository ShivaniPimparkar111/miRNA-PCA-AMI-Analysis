# PCA & Clustering of miRNA Profiles in Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI)

**Course**: BF550 Project 2  
**Author**: Shivani Pimparkar  
**Dataset**: GSE24548 – miRNA profiling of FAMI patients vs healthy controls

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project explores the potential of **microRNAs (miRNAs)** as biomarkers for cardiovascular disease, specifically **acute myocardial infarction (AMI)**. Using a dataset from the GEO database (GSE24548), I applied **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** and **hierarchical clustering** to distinguish expression patterns in **platelet-derived miRNA** profiles.

## 📊 Methods

- 📦 Data retrieved using GEOparse
- ✅ Preprocessed and labeled samples as "Patient" or "Control"
- 📉 Applied PCA (3D visualization)
- 🔥 Generated a heatmap of 37 discriminative miRNAs
- 📌 Visualized group separation using color-coded plots

---

## 🧠 Key Results

- 🧬 PCA revealed clear separation between FAMI patients and controls.
- 🔍 First 3 PCs explained **98%** of total variance (PC1: 47.33%, PC2: 25.85%, PC3: 12.80%)
- 🌡️ Heatmap showed distinct clusters and miRNA signatures associated with AMI
- 📌 Potential biomarkers include **miR-21**, **miR-199a-5p**
